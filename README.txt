In this project you can find some algorithms of cluster analysis write on C++ programming language.

At this moment here you can find:
1) Wave algorithm
2) DBSCAN
3) Expectation maximization
3) K-Means
4) K-Means with cores
5) Spanning tree
6) Formal element
7) Hierarch algorithm
8) Triangulation Delaunay's

Also this algorithms implemented with used client-server technology.

Among the other things it is present algorithm to prediction value of function by dots in neighborhood (with average coefficent r^2 equal to 0.78), with possibility to rejection of the forecast.
