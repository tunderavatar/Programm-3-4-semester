Generation_Ð¡loud mx my sx sy N		- create a cloud with specified parametrs: double mean X-axis - mx, double mean Y-axis - my, double distribution X-axis - sx, double distribution Y-axis - sy, int count of dots - N

GC mx my sx sy N	- the same thing
Generation_Cloud 	- Create a cloud with one dot and standard parametrs of distribution (mx = 0, my = 0, sx = 1, sy = 1, N = 100)
GC 	- The same thing

INFO	- Print on console count of clouds, count of dots in all clouds in field.
HELP	- Print on console all command, which controller can do

GetCloud N 		- Take N-th cloud in a row in buffer
GetC N 	- The same thing
GetCloud 	- Take all clouds from field in buffer
GetC	-The same thing

SetCloud N boo ch param1 param2	- Put N-th cloud in a row from buffer on field if boo = false, else put in field N-th cloud in a row from buffer with changes: if ch = 'r' - rotate cloud on param1 radian cloud; if ch = 's' - shift cloud on param1 at X-axis and param2 at Y-axis; if ch = 'h' - homothety with positive coefficient param1 -- on field

SetC N  boo ch param1 param2		- The same thing
